Breaking changes
----------------

- the :ref:`pkg-support.modbus` support module was upgraded from 3-2 to 3-4,
  which changed the name of the ``modbus.dbd`` file.
  This file wasn't meant to be used,
  but if you used it by mistake,
  make sure to include ``modbusSupport.dbd``,
  and ``drvAsynIPPort.dbd`` or ``drvAsynSerialPort.dbd`` instead.
