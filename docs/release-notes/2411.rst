24.11 Release notes
===================

.. role:: nix(code)
   :language: nix

Breaking changes
----------------

- the :ref:`pkg-support.modbus` support module was upgraded from 3-2 to 3-4,
  which changed the name of the ``modbus.dbd`` file.
  This file wasn't meant to be used,
  but if you used it by mistake,
  make sure to include ``modbusSupport.dbd``,
  and ``drvAsynIPPort.dbd`` or ``drvAsynSerialPort.dbd`` instead.

- :nix:option:`services.phoebus-olog` now uses FerretDB instead of MongoDB,
  which prevents having to compile a resource intensive project
  due to its license.
  Migrate your data by following :ref:`mongodb-to-ferretdb`.
