# EPNix NixOS

This directory contains EPICS extensions NixOS modules, tests, and
documentation, for example modules for configuring an Archiver Appliance
server, a Phoebus Alarm server, a Channel Access gateway, etc.

This shouldn't be confused with the `ioc/` directory, which contains
NixOS-like modules, tests, and documentation for building an EPICS IOC.
